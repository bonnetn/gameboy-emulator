# Gameboy emulator

This is a very rough implementation of a [Gameboy emulator (DMG-01)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy).

It is able to run Gameboy games. 

It implements a gameboy CPU and a PPU (pixel processing unit, used for drawing on the screen).

Some of the codes has been generated (i.e. CPU instruction functions).

### Testing
This has been tested using [Blaarg's test ROMs](https://gbdev.gg8.se/files/roms/blargg-gb-tests/) and [Matt Curie's test ROM](https://github.com/mattcurrie/dmg-acid2). 
I also tested it on few games.
